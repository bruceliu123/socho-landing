		<div class="row">

<h4><b>What personal information does the app collect and why?</b></h4>
<p>
The personal information that we may collect about you through the Services broadly falls into the following categories: when you play our Games or visit our Website, we may collect certain information automatically from your device; this information may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws. Also from time to time, you may send us personal information voluntarily, for example when you email us for support.
</p>
<h4><b>Information that we collect automatically in our Games</b></h4>
<p>
We automatically collect certain types of information whenever you interact with our Games, via a 3rd party analytics partner such as Unity, Firebase. This information is stored in our partner’s servers, and visible to us in anonymous, aggregated or pseudonymized form which does not focus on you individually.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, this may include information like your device type, unique device identification numbers, broad geographic location (e.g. country derived from IP address) and technical information such as crash reporting. In addition, we may collect information about your interactions with our Games, such as how long you play for, or whether you’ve encountered any technical glitches.
</p>
<p>
This type of anonymized data enables us to figure out how players use our Games, so we can make improvements to our Games over time, such as fixing bugs or identifying areas of the game which are too difficult.
</p>
<p>
In addition, in some of our free to play games we also partner with mobile advertising networks, such as Mopub, Admob. Each of these companies collect some pseudonymized usage data from players, such as whether or not a player finishes watching an ad all the way through, or whether or not a user clicks on an ad.
